I am a 3rd-year PhD student in CS at George Mason University, advised by [Prof. ThanhVu Nguyen](https://dynaroars.github.io/people/nguyenthanhvuh/). My research is on the intersection of LLMs, formal mathematics and proof assistants, with a particular focus on combinatorics domain and [LEAN proof assistant](https://lean-lang.org/). 

Prior to my PhD, I obtained my B.E. from Hanoi University of Science and Technology in Hà Nội, Việt Nam. My undergraduate research, under the guidance of [Prof. Huynh Thi Thanh Binh](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/binhht/), focused on combining Evolutionary Algorithms and Deep Learning for solving combinatorial optimization problems. I also spent two years at VinAI Research as an AI Resident working with my mentor [Dr. Dat Quoc Nguyen](https://datquocnguyen.github.io/) on Vietnamese-English machine translation.
